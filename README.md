    Encourages continuous feedback and client involvement.
    Promotes incremental development, leading to quicker deliverables.
    Disadvantages:
    Less predictable as it can be challenging to forecast time and costs precisely.
    Requires high client engagement, which can be resource-intensive.
    Potentially harder to manage with larger teams.
    
  Waterfall:
    Advantages:
    Structured and straightforward, making it easier to manage for projects with well-defined requirements.
    Clear project milestones make it easier to track progress and estimate timelines and costs.
    Effective for projects with stable, unchanging requirements.
    Disadvantages:
    Limited flexibility to accommodate changes once development begins.
    Potentially longer time to deliver a working product as testing occurs later in the process.
    Client feedback can only be incorporated after each phase, leading to delayed course corrections.
    
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
  Agile is more beneficial for:
    Dynamic projects with evolving requirements. For instance, mobile app development often benefits from Agile due to constant updates based on user feedback and evolving       market trends.
    Projects requiring frequent client interaction and feedback, such as SaaS products where clients expect frequent updates.
    
  Waterfall is more beneficial for:
    Projects with well-defined and stable requirements, such as government software or compliance projects where regulatory requirements are set in advance.
    Construction of software infrastructure like network systems where each phase builds upon the previous one with limited room for changes.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
  Quality assurance (QA) is essential for ensuring that the software meets required standards, is reliable, and performs as expected. High standards prevent costly post-       release fixes and improve user satisfaction. Methods for maintaining QA include:
  
  Regular code reviews: Catch issues early and ensure coding standards are followed.
  Automated testing: Use unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing to verify functionality.
  Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD): Ensures that new code is tested and integrated frequently.
  User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Validates the software in a real-world setting before release.
  Defining QA metrics: Track defects, test coverage, and response time for early insights into potential issues.
  
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
  Defining the project scope sets clear boundaries for the project, aligning stakeholders on deliverables, objectives, and limitations. This minimizes misunderstandings and    reduces scope creep, making resource and time planning more effective.
  
  A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the project into smaller, manageable tasks or components. It is useful because it:
  i.  Improves planning and scheduling by breaking down complex tasks into manageable parts.
  ii.  Clarifies roles and responsibilities by detailing each task and associated resources.
  ii.  Facilitates progress tracking by offering measurable units to assess completion status.
  iv.  Enhances communication by providing a clear structure and roadmap to all stakeholders.

  
## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
  A detailed project schedule provides a roadmap for project timelines, helping manage resources, track progress, and meet deadlines. Benefits include:
    i. Clear milestones and expectations: Team members know what to accomplish at each stage, which improves accountability.
    ii. Improved time management: Allows better allocation of resources and time across tasks.
    iii. Enhanced risk management: Identifies potential bottlenecks early on.
    iv. Efficient communication: Team members and stakeholders have a shared understanding of timelines.
  Gantt charts are visual tools that illustrate a project schedule by mapping out tasks on a timeline. They assist by:
    i. Showing task dependencies: Helps identify critical paths and dependencies to avoid delays.
    ii. Enabling quick adjustments: Managers can update timelines and dependencies visually.
    iii. Tracking progress: Progress bars on Gantt charts give a real-time view of task completion.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
